It will tell you if you should expect to have excess cash or if you will be needing cash. If you need cash to grow, the projection will show your banker when he can expect to get his money back. It will also help you plan when you will need to hire more people and add more equipment and/or facilities. Financial projections are part of the answer for a business owner who is tired of flying by the seat of his pants.

                      All businesses have key factors that, if monitored, can give an indication of how the business doing. Monitoring such factors has an advantage over looking only at financial results. Financial statements are historical documents. They can only tell you what has already happened, and they usually do that the month following the events. Key indicators can tell you what is happening today and can sometimes predict what will happen in the future. We may find key factors in production, distribution, overtime statistics, sales operations, order taking, cash collections, inventory levels, backlog statistics, or other areas depending on the type of business you are in. We can identify these factors and set up a process for tracking and analyzing them.

                      As businesses grow and change, their organizational structure frequently evolves into one that is less than optimum. The present structure is not what one would create if they were starting the business from scratch. The business may have become one that has misallocations of resources. It may not function like the well-oiled machine it once was. We can look at your business objectively, help you visualize your optimum structure, and create a plan to implement the changes that you decide you want to make.

                      Our clients have one or more people who handle the day to day transactions of the company. We can manage these staff members onsite at a frequency determined by the client’s needs. This allows the business owner to focus on other aspects of the business rather than spending time managing the accounting function. We will identify staff members who are in the wrong job, and we can help find suitable replacements. We also recommend incentive plans for them.

Banks make money by lending money; however, the inexperience of many small business owners in financial matters often prompts banks to deny loan requests.You must know exactly how much money you need, why you need it, and how you will pay it back.
